## Requirements

Start by providing a short and concise title. Donâ€™t put something generic (e.g. bug fixes),
and instead mention more specifically what your PR achieves. For instance "Fixes panic in database component" or "Implement Microsoft blah blah"

The PR description should go into better details about what your PR adds,removes or fixes.
Firstly, the description should include a link to any relevant issues or discussions surrounding the
feature or bug that your PR addresses.

Please make sure you [properly style and format your changes](/styling)

### Tests

#### Backend

We really love tests. As much as possible, please include them in your PR.

> Things like new commands usually in the `cmd/` path are fine to skip tests for but others need really

#### Frontend

We do not have FE tests and no plans of adding them at this time :))
