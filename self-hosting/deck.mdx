When sharing your deck to investors, you ideally need a nice
slide UI to present the data to them. You also need that to do either of the
following:

- Accept emails and use that as part of your fundraising crm
- Prevent unauthorized access by locking the deck down with passwords hence you are in communication
  with everyone who views it and can add that to your fundraising pipeline .

The deck viewer is open sourced too. You can find it [on Github](https://github.com/ayinke-llc/malak-deck) and
install from there

## Configuration
