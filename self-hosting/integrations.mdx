## Syncing data

In the dashboard app, after connecting the Integrations, you need to periodically
pull in or sync in the data from the intergation into Malak so as to graph and create charts
as you wish. Or even include them in your investors' updates.

```sh
malak cron integrations
```

<Tip>
  Running this once daily is fine. Maybe at 11pm or 11:30pm or something
</Tip>

<Info>It is safe to run multiple times in a day too but not needed</Info>
