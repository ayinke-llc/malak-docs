We publish new releases in two major ways:

- Docker images
- Binaries

## Docker

Our images are hosted on [Github Packages](https://github.com/ayinke-llc/malak/pkgs/container/malak).
And the url is `ghcr.io/ayinke-llc/malak`. We usually publish releases in the following format: `0.1.2`. As an example,
if you wanted the `0.7.5` release, you need to do the following:

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/ayinke-llc/malak:0.7.5
```

### Other versions

If you wanted to live on the edge a little bit or needed a new feature which has not landed into a
release. Or you just want us to dogfood Malak in production, we publish new images on every commit.

So you can just take the commit hash ( first 8 characters ) and append
instead of the version tag e.g

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/ayinke-llc/malak:17cdd5ed
```

## Binary

We publish new releases [on Github](https://github.com/ayinke-llc/malak/releases). You will
find compiled binaries for Linux , macOS (`arm` and `x86`). And also Windows.

> There are no nightly releases for binaries unlike for the docker images. We only build and publish them when we tag or cut a new release

## Build yourself

You can build the project yourself by just cloning the project and running `go build -o malak cmd/*.go`
