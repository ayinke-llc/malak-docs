Malak is 100% opensource, we do not have any closed source component. But if you want to do any of the following:

## Resell Malak

You can do so with our Commercial License. The license can be acquired by sending an email to `support@ayinke.ventures` with the title
or a variant of **Commercial Licensing**.

This is an extremely straight forward process and we try to close this as
soon as possible - ideally in single digit days.
