## Sending investors updates

We only schedule updates when you send in the dashboard. We do not send immediately.
Instead we rely on a background job to actually process the updates and send them to
the recipients.

```sh
malak cron updates
```

<Tip>
  Ideally you want to configure this to run once a day. Or even once a month.
  Depending on how much updates you are sending. You can even run this every 30
  minutes
</Tip>

<Tip>
  We use chrome headless to render your charts, then convert them to images we
  can attach in the emails. For this purpose, it is highly recommended you add
  `google-chrome` to your machine or make it available
</Tip>

## Aggregating Deck viewing analytics

We collect reasonable data when a deck is shared and viewed. But to process them and make them
human readable ( more like dashbaord readable ), we have to aggregate and process them.

```sh
malak cron deck-analytics
```

<Tip>
  Run this depending on how much delay is fine for the deck data analytics to
  show up in the dashboard. 30 minutes? once a day? 10 times a day?
</Tip>
