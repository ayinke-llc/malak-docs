We use database migrations in order to handle changes to the
database schema in a secure and stable way. This is also useful when adding new features amongst others.

## Run migration

Before updating the version of Malak you have, please always run the migration command to make sure
new database schemas are applied to support either features or bugfixes accompanied with the new Malak release.

```bash
malak migrate
```

This can be automated as part of your release/upgrade processes.
