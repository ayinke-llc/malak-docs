We do not store secrets or api keys as-is in the database instead
we use a form of secret management system, we currently support a few
which will be listed before. Our source code is 100% public and you can view
the implementations on [Github](https://github.com/ayinke-llc/malak/tree/main/internal/secret).

We also deploy the exact version on Github to our prod servers without any modification
whatsoever. Our deployment can be found on [github too](https://github.com/ayinke-llc/malak/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml)

<Warning>
  There currently isn't a migration process from one provider to another but it
  is something we might explore in the future. Which is also why we have chosen
  to support only the most reliable and popular managers
</Warning>

### AES

<Tip>
  We highly recommend this as it does not require you to set up another infra
</Tip>

> While this is not a secret manager, `aes-gcm` encrypts your data before being stored in the database.

<CodeGroup>

```txt env
MALAK_SECRETS_PROVIDER=aes_gcm
MALAK_SECRETS_AES_KEY=ujffjkfk
```

```yml yaml
secrets:
  provider: aes_gcm
  aes:
    key: ujffjkfk
```

</CodeGroup>

You can generate you `aes_gcm` key with `LC_ALL=C tr -dc 'A-Za-z0-9' </dev/urandom | head -c 32; echo`

### Hashicorp Vault

<CodeGroup>

```txt env
MALAK_SECRETS_PROVIDER=vault
MALAK_SECRETS_VAULT_ADDRESS=ujffjkfk
MALAK_SECRETS_VAULT_TOKEN=ujffjkfk
MALAK_SECRETS_VAULT_PATH=ujffjkfk
```

```yml yaml
secrets:
  provider: vault
  vault:
    address: ujffjkfk
    token: ujffjkfk
    path: ujffjkfk
```

</CodeGroup>

### Infisical

<CodeGroup>

```txt env
MALAK_SECRETS_PROVIDER=infisical
MALAK_SECRETS_INFISICAL_CLIENT_ID=ujffjkfk
MALAK_SECRETS_INFISICAL_CLIENT_SECRET=ujffjkfk
MALAK_SECRETS_INFISICAL_SITE_URL=ujffjkfk
MALAK_SECRETS_INFISICAL_ENVIRONMENT=ujffjkfk
```

```yml yaml
secrets:
  provider: infisical
  infisical:
    client_id: ujffjkfk
    client_secret: ujffjkfk
    site_url: ujffjkfk
    environment: prod

### AWS Secrets Manager

```txt env
MALAK_SECRETS_PROVIDER=secrets_manager
MALAK_SECRETS_SECRETS_MANAGER_REGION=eu-west-2
MALAK_SECRETS_SECRETS_MANAGER_ACCESS_KEY=jgkjfk
MALAK_SECRETS_SECRETS_MANAGER_ACCESS_SECRET=jgkjfk
MALAK_SECRETS_SECRETS_MANAGER_ENDPOINT=eu-west-2
